                BMX</h2>
                    <p><img src="./BMX1.jpg" class="current-bikes"> <p>Developed to bridge the gap between
                        motocross and Bicycles, BMX is a stunts
                        and ramps coordinated style of riding. Short bursts of energy
                        propel you from one side of a skate park to another,whilist tackling obstacles along the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>BMX has a lot of advantages- it's extremely fun, and can be ridden both indoor 
                        and outdoors. it's an all year round sport which doesn't require all the
                         kit you would usually take on
                        the trails if you're a mountain biker at heart.
                    </p>

                    <p>BMX bikes are fairly cheap in the grand
                        scheme of bikes, with entry levels starting from 
                        $150. With the growing popularity of cycling, more
                        skate-parks and indoor facilities are opening up
                        around the country - so why not give it a go?!

                <p><img src="./tandem1.jpg" class="current-bikes"><p>Dating back to the late 1800's, the tandem bike was
                    developed to be ridden by more than one person
                    at a time. Commonly regarded as a novelty cycle,
                    which you would often see around tourist and holiday
                    destinations, tandems are actually rather popular in the 
                    race scene
                </p>

                <p>Road, off-road and fat-bike tandem have began
                    to  creep onto the scene in force.
                    And ask why not? They are fun and they put 
                    a whole new spin on "team work". 
                    Tandem riding is harder than it looks because you're 
                    riding for the both of you which requires a lot  of trust,
                    and a lot of effort to synchronise fitness abilities
                    and cadence
                </p>

                <p>It's great fun to try out, with a lot of 
                parks, bikes stores and tourist facilities hiring 
                 them out</p>

                 but with mountain tires.  Cyclocross is  a messy,

                <p> 
                    CX racing asks for a lot of power from the rider, 
                    to pedal through difficult and challenging terrain, but it
                    also requires some technical skill as well. 
                    usually consisting of short laps, this sixty minute racing
                     style will have you working every muscle and using all yur

                <p>Professional atheletes such as downhill rider,
                    train in the off-season with cyclocross. Seeing as it's 
                    a transition discipline between road and mountain, many atheletes
                    and hobbyists enjoy the elements from each major discipline

                        and with soft supple suspension, it makes climbing a 
                        bitter sweet affair. All aspects from the climbing

                <p>Covering miles and trees on a mountain bike is a fanstatic way

                    <p>Hybrid bikes are best described as a mix of road, Mountain
                        and touring bike designs, making them more of
                        "do-it-all" kind of bikes that cater to a wide
                        range of uses. These bikes usually sport a combination 
                        of large road bike sized wheels that make them work amazingly
                        well on both paved trails and smooth dirt. They also
                        feature a flat bar and a headsup ride to ensure better
                        view and comfort while riding.  They may often contain disc
                        brakes for responsive and impressive braking, especially
                        when riding in turbulent weather conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many hybrid bikes that are considered as commuted-friendly
                    models include fenders, racks and lighting systems.
                However, it is important to note that
            <q>No two hybrid bikes are entirely same to you.</q></p>
